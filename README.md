### Notes to myself
1. For HW1:
  - Just simply biuld tables that you need
  - DO NOT forget your root password
2. For HW2:
  - Goal: This homework aims to connect the CRUD backend & frontend and also connect with mysql workbench
  - Step 1. source code download from [here](https://github.com/machadop1407/Simple-CRUD-React-Node-MySQL) and this is the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3OIOr9dJI&t=0s). You can also learn CRUD in mandarin Chinese by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e98hQpi8Pac&t=186s), which is recorded by [Irene Chang](https://github.com/41071119H-Irene), one of my best classmate ever.
  - Step 2. instructions to remember
    (i) create new folders: client, server
    (ii)
    - client (react) :
      > npm create react-app client
      > npm start  
        (**remind that you need to change director to your client folder before typing npm start**)
      > Get into the "src"folder from the source code we'e hust downloaded (client > src), copy three files: App.css, App.js, and index.js
      > Replace these files into your client>src we've just added by "npm"
      > If "axios" doesn't exist, "npm install axios"
  - server (node.js):
      **(remind that you need to change directr to your server folder before giving instructions)**
      > npm init
      Then, there should automatically appear a "package.json" file in your server folder after ˋnpm initˋ
      > add "index.js" file to the server folder
      >
    (iii)
      Change the names of our tables and columns from index. js(in server folder) and App.js(in client folder) respecitvely

4. For HW3:
  - Goal: using mongodb to access our data in mysql
  - useful resources:
    - [backend](https://www.tutussfunny.com/mern-full-stack-complete-application-mongodb-express-react-node-js/)
    - [mongodb tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDOKSgqM-bQ)
There are two ways to get to our goal
  (i) Method 1, by installing. Referenced from my intellegent classmate [huwalli](https://github.com/Huwalli).
      Tutorial playlist that I checked : [Complete MongoDB Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojKJqNQYaOI). For this homework, we need only video 1~4 (merely for learning how to use the tool and install it)
      - notes to myself: neccessary downloading: mongadb community server & mongodb compass
  (ii) Method 2, by scripts.
      - videos that our professro recommanded us
        - [Build app using React JS, Node Express JS and Mongo DB (MERN Stack)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDgKjb5eWPk)
        - [Nodejs React with Mongodb (MERN) Crud App(MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzAr3TJKHg)
      - Step1:
